                                <p>In addition to the exacting updates made to the documentation - sometimes changing chemical volumes by mere mililiters, she was also required to use her judgement to determine the impact of changing a single line of instruction.She did all of this with an incredible range of tools from MS Word '97 to the CCMS manager Elisys.</p>

                                <p className="job-title">Founding member</p>
                                <p>One of the best ways for writers to improve is to share their work and submit it for feedback. Indianapolis lacked a forum for their theater/playwrighting community so Mary joined other writers in establishing the Playwrights Circle as part of the Indiana Writers Center. The group established a regular Scene Night where writers could hear their work read by actors and solitic feedback from their peers.</p>
                                <p>Mary hosted scene night both in-person prior to the pandemic and virtually following it.  She volunteered to run the Table Reads. She coordinates the cast of actors and and helps turn out an audience for a reading of the full script. After the performance she hosts a discussion of the work to help guide the author in its further development.</p>

                                <p>As a member of the Board Mary Beth helped with fundraising. She volunteered at author events where she represented the Writers Center to the general public. Most importantly she served on the committee that formed the center's Strategic Plan for their future.</p>

                                <p className="job-title">Selected Playwright</p>
                                <p>The IndyFringe Theatre sponsored a festival celebrating the new works of Indianapolis women playwrights. Mary Beth's one act play <span className="italics">Unholy Trinity</span> was selected for a place in the festival.</p>
                                <p>Her romantic comedy personifying the Mind, Heart and Body as they search for love was a stand-out success.  It sold out each of 4 performances. Mary was very involved with the production, selecting the director and running auditions. She worked with the cast and the festival organizers to adapt the script to suit the format and the needs of the actors.</p>

                                <p>Indianapolis is a sports town, but for a brief moment the city brought its artists and makers together for some retro-futuristic fun. Steampunk is blend of science fiction and fantasy that blends pre-digital technology with a Victorian aesthic.</p>
                                <p>Mary Beth took over the organizing role for the 2016 Steampunk Ball. In doing so she had the responsibility of booking the venue and coordiating with the artists and entertainers.  She oversaw the marketing and set the theme for the event.</p>
