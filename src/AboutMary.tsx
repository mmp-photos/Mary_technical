        <h2>About Mary Beth</h2>

        <p>Mary Beth writes with the precision of a Purdue-trained technical writer. She edits and provides feedback with the deft hand of someone who has spent years leading and submitting work to writer's groups.</p>
        <p>A thorough researcher Mary Beth prides herself both on the number of citations and the impeccible formatting of her footnotes.</p>
        <p>Remote work provides Mary Beth the opportunity to work for great companies while remaining close to her Indianapolis community. She is a founding member of the Indianapolis Playwrights Circle and has served as a board member for the Indiana Writers Center.</p>
        <p>Although writing is Mary Beth's craft she prefers to use her skills in positions that have a positive impact on the world.  Nothing is better than doing good.
