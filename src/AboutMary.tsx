        <h2>About Mary</h2>
        <p>Mary Karty is on a mission to eliminate ambiguity. Clear communication is her passion. She understands that "average" just won't do when the difference between median and mean can be the difference between life and death.</p>
        <p>Mary writes with the precision of a Purdue-trained technical writer. She edits and provides feedback with the deft hand of someone who has spent years leading and submitting work to writer's groups.</p>
        <p>A thorough researcher Mary prides herself both on the number of citations and the impeccible formatting of her footnotes.</p>
        <p>Remote work provides Mary the opportunity to work for great companies while remaining close to her Indianapolis community. She is a founding member of the Indianapolis Playwrights Circle and has served as a board member for the Indiana Writers Center.</p>
        <p>Although writing is Mary's craft she prefers to use her skills in positions that have a positive impact on the world.  Nothing is better than doing good. With her love of biology and life sciences and her technical experience creating user guides and documenting APIs Mary is ideally suited to work with medical devices and equipment that requires approval from the FDA.</p>
