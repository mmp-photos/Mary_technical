        <p>AI is a revolutionary technology that will change the world and the nature of work. It will be a powerful tool in the hands of responsible writers and editors.</p>
        <p>Current tools can speed up research and compiling and organizing sources, even summarizing the contents.  But the heart of editing is still in making critical judgements and that is something that none of the available models is able to do. With the ease of assembling the information having a trusted editor to review the sources for credibility and accuracy is more important than ever.</p>
        <p>LLMs may have been trained on the Chicago Manual of Style but do they have a principled position on the Oxford Comma debate? Can you trust the editorial judgement of someone who doesn't?</p>
        <p>I am happy to use new and developing tools in my workflow, but I will never let them do my job.</p>
